## This is based on...

This project was created with `create-svelte` following Joy of Code's tutorial https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-authentication-using-cookies

The authentication scheme has been extended to match cookies against the id of `authentication` records in the database instead of matching cookies against the id of `user` records. This is more secure because the authentication records expire and are less likely to be leaked than the user id.

## Pomonator

This is in early stages of development and currently not usable. 

Pomonator is a student/teacher, task assignment and management application
with integrated time tracking and "pomodoro technique" style features, allowing
students to easily keep track of their work, take breaks and see where they have
spent their time.
